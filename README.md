# Securing-Docker-Containers
I have written a blog post that discusses best practices for securing Docker containers and keeping them safe from potential security threats. These best practices include keeping containers updated, using only trusted images, minimizing image size, using multi-stage builds, limiting container privileges, using Docker Security Scanning, using network segmentation, and considering container orchestration for managing containers at scale. Additionally, the post mentions several tools that can be used to improve Docker container security, such as Docker Bench Security, Clair, Aqua Security, and Anchore. By following these best practices and using security tools, you can minimize the risk of vulnerabilities and keep your Docker containers secure.
